The significance of union and intersection types in TypeScript

UNION TYPES:

Union type means a variable will take more than one type of data. We use this "|" symbol to use union types.
Use case: One of the use cases of this type could be to define api response. Like we can define 2 types for Success or Error for response and use union type for the api response. Based on the response we can us one of the type for our purposes.

INTERSECTION TYPES: 

Intersection type means we can assign multiple types to a variable, and for the variable, both types must be true. We use this "&" symbol to use intersection types.
